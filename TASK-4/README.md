 Logistic Regression Binary Classifier

This project demonstrates how to build a binary classifier using Logistic Regression on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

 Files
- cleaned_data.csv - Cleaned dataset used for modeling.
- logistic_regression.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook with full analysis and model.
- README.md - Project overview and instructions.

 Workflow
1. Load and explore the dataset.
2. Split into training/testing sets.
3. Standardize the features.
4. Train logistic regression model.
5. Evaluate with:
   - Confusion matrix
   - Precision, recall, F1
   - ROC curve and AUC
6. Tune the classification threshold.
7. Explain the sigmoid function used by logistic regression.

Open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code and run cells step by step.
